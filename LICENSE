How to license the Swiss Ephemeris:

The Swiss Ephemeris is not a product for end users. It is a toolset for programmers to build into their astrological software.

Swiss Ephemeris is made available by its authors under a dual licensing system. The software developer, who uses any part of Swiss Ephemeris in his or her software, must choose between one of the two license models, which are

a) GNU public license version 2 or later

b) Swiss Ephemeris Professional License

The choice must be made before the software developer distributes software containing parts of Swiss Ephemeris to others, and before any public service using the developed software is activated.

If the developer choses the GNU GPL software license, he or she must fulfill the conditions of that license, which includes the obligation to place his or her whole software project under the GNU GPL or a compatible license. 
See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html

If the developer choses the Swiss Ephemeris Professional license, he must follow the instructions below and purchase the Swiss Ephemeris Professional Edition from Astrodienst and sign the corresponding license contract.

The License grants you the right to use, copy, modify and redistribute Swiss Ephemeris, but only under certain conditions described in the License. Among other things, the License requires that the copyright notices and this notice be preserved on all copies.

Authors of the Swiss Ephemeris: Dieter Koch and Alois Treindl

The authors of Swiss Ephemeris have no control or influence over any of the derived works, i.e. over software or services created by other programmers which use Swiss Ephemeris functions.

The names of the authors or of the copyright holder (Astrodienst) must not be used for promoting any software, product or service which uses or contains the Swiss Ephemeris. This copyright notice is the ONLY place where the names of the authors can legally appear, except in cases where they have given special permission in writing.

Both types of licenses include the right to use the label 'Swiss Ephemeris Inside' on products..
